Error handling. I have discovered a bug that causes the page to crash when the user enters a clan id that is missing clan information in

the clan description. I have patched this bug to display an error message so that the app does not crash. 

With that aside, I will be ending the development cycle of this project after just 1 month. I have made this decision due to 2 reasons. 

1) Most of the coding from this point on feels very boilerplate. Most of it just consists of parsing information

called from the api dictionary. It is not very fun nor do I feel as if I am learning much from it. 

2) At a career fair yesterday, a cyber security recruiter told me about the idea of hacking challenges

that their company posts on their website. I find these intriguing. I think I will devote my free time to these instead from now on.
