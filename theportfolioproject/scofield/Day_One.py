Hello. 

The first semester of my sophomore year has nearly ended. I have come to realize that I have not made much progress on the goals that I initially set for myself at the beginning of the semester. I remembered opening a new Leetcode account, telling myself that I would practice a LeetCode question once per day. I have not touched that account since the day I opened it. 

Time seems to fly by. And there’s really no one to hold me accountable except for myself. 

Anyways, I have decided to start a personal coding project in python. I think this will be a good way to practice python for leetcode questions.

I am thinking about creating an algorithm that helps Clash of Clans players determine what is the most optimal thing to allocate their village resources towards. This will allow them to progress their village and game accounts as fast as possible. I think this will be especially useful since TownHall 18 dropped about two weeks ago. 


Hopefully… 

This is not something that I will end up dropping after day 1 like my leetcode account….
